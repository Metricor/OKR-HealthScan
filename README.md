# OKR-HealthScan

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an "OKR HealthScan" tool. Its purpose is to proactively assess the health and risk of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) within an organization. By analyzing various input factors, it will generate a comprehensive health score and visualize key insights, enabling timely interventions and improved OKR attainment.

## Phase 1: Deep Dive & Data Structuring - IN PROGRESS
This phase focuses on defining the core inputs for the tool, conceptualizing the logic for scoring OKR health/risk, and establishing the foundational data structures.

### Current Status
- Initial repository setup.
- Defining input fields and attributes.
- Brainstorming preliminary scoring logic.

## Getting Started

## Future Phases
- **Phase 2:** Core Logic Development (Processing)
- **Phase 3:** Visualization & Dashboard Development (Outputs & Visuals)
- **Phase 4:** Refinement, Testing
